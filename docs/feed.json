Making you appreciate how spacious it is.</p>\n\n<p>The combination of cement floor, white walls, wooden furnitures, yellow hue light bulbs,\nand the touch of greens from the indoor plants do a great job in giving off a warm homey feeling.</p>\n\n<p><img src=\"/assets/img/cohere04.jpg\" alt=\"\" class=\"size-small\" /></p>\n\n<p>The space is divided into 4 separate sections:</p>\n<ul>\n  <li>The area over the main entrance that resembles a living room</li>\n  <li>The area nearby the coffee bar</li>\n  <li>The more private middle area separated by a sliding glass door that can serve as a co-working/meeting space</li>\n  <li>The small outdoor smoking area in the back which is visible from inside through a huge window.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p><img src=\"/assets/img/cohere02.jpg\" alt=\"\" class=\"size-small\" /></p>\n\n<h3 id=\"the-menu\">The Menu</h3>\n\n<p>Once you step into the counter area, you’ll be able to see the pastries they have on display along with the menu. All food and drinks are halal.</p>\n\n<p>They offer the common espresso based as well as non-coffee drinks which includes selection of healthy smoothies.\nMy usual, is either a <a href=\"https://www.cafeculture.com/industry/general-interest/what-is-a-piccolo-latte\">piccolo latte</a>, es kopi susu (iced coffee with milk), or a cup of <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Espresso\">espresso</a>.\nCan’t go wrong with espresso.</p>\n\n<p>For their coffee beans, Cohere uses its own house blend which is 100% arabica, as they don’t provide anything but specialty coffee.\nTheir latest addition to the menu, es kopi susu in 1L bottle is now catering for the growing demand of home es kopi susu stock.</p>\n\n<p>For foods, they have a wide selection of appetiser/snack, mains and desserts.\n<a href=\"https://www.zomato.com/jakarta/cohere-bogor-timur-bogor\">Cohere’s page in zomato</a> has all the details.\nIf you ask me, I particularly like the pink carbonara and the brownies with ice cream.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"the-service\">The service</h3>\n\n<p>Cohere opens everyday from 8.00AM - 9.30PM.</p>\n\n<p>The staffs are very friendly and know what they’re doing.\nThe order doesn’t take long; it normally takes around 5 - 10 minutes for drinks and 15 - 20 minutes for food.\nAnd if you need to, you can keep the bill open. Which is convenient!</p>\n\n<p>Price wise, it’s slightly above your average coffee place in Bogor, but worth every penny. <sub> (in this case, worth every perak)</sub></p>\n\n<p>For payment they accept: cash, OVO, go-pay and BCA debit card.\nThey are not able to accept credit card or debit card other than BCA yet (confirmation required).</p>\n\n<p>Another important facts, the toilet is squeaky clean and they offer public wi-fi.</p>\n\n<p><b style=\"color:#50A14F\">Side-note</b>: If you ever happen to meet Sumi, one of the co-founders, have a chat.\nYou should go ahead and ask for his food or drink recommendation or maybe just talk about coffee.\nGreat guy to talk to.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"the-crowd\">The crowd</h3>\n\n<p><b style=\"color:#50A14F\">Prior to Covid19</b>: Mostly frequented by the younger spectrum of the population, Cohere is the most crowded during weekends around lunchtime until the afternoon. For anyone who’s wondering, it’s also family friendly and the smoking/non-smoking area distinction is very clear.</p>\n\n<p>Occasionally the place will be booked for social/work related functions and you might find that there’s limited seating, so it might be a good idea to make a reservation beforehand.</p>\n\n<p><b style=\"color:#E45649\">During Covid19</b>: Following the transition from large-scale social restrictions to the so called new-normal,\nCohere has re-open for dine-in with physical distancing measures. Reservation is recommended during this time.\nThey will also require you to wash your hand the moment you enter the coffee shop.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"must-visit\">Must visit?</h3>\n\n<p>A 100%! I really enjoyed the homey feel that it offers. Even when compared to coffee shops in Jakarta, I’d still say that Cohere would be one of my top choices.</p>\n\n<p>I can’t say I’ve eaten every dish on the menu, but the ones I did try definitely did not disappoint.\nAs for the coffee, they consistently serve really good quality coffee.</p>\n\n<p>10 out if 10 times, I recommended Cohere to friends or family visiting Bogor whenever they asked for my recommendation.</p>\n\n<iframe src=\"https://www.google.com/maps/embed?pb=!1m18!1m12!1m3!1d3963.3331457576564!2d106.81021931466412!3d-6.605459395223172!2m3!1f0!2f0!3f0!3m2!1i1024!2i768!4f13.1!3m3!1m2!1s0x2e69c5de710a1311%3A0x7bb49088d326fd02!2sCohere!5e0!3m2!1sen!2sid!4v1596386386914!5m2!1sen!2sid\" width=\"600\" height=\"450\" frameborder=\"0\" style=\"border:0;\" allowfullscreen=\"\" aria-hidden=\"false\" tabindex=\"0\" class=\"size-small\"></iframe>\n\n<p>It’s a great spot to add to your destination list when in Bogor. Either to just hang out or to wait the traffic out before driving back to Jakarta.</p>\n\n<p>Give it a shot when you’re in Bogor. <sub>(Or if you’re living in Bogor but have never been to Cohere before)</sub></p>\n\n<hr />","excerpt":"TL;DR.","languages":null,"categories":["life"],"tags":["misc","pin"]},{"title":"Setting up blog using Duo","permalink":"https://ezral.net/Setting-up-blog-using-Leonids.html","link":"https://ezral.net/Setting-up-blog-using-Leonids.html","date":"2020-07-20T00:00:00+00:00","modified":"2020-07-30T09:59:21+00:00","author":{"name":"Ezral","url":"https://ezral.net/","email":"a@ezral.net"},"content":"<p>Setting up blogs using Jekyll is great!\nThis is how you can set up a jekyll blog using <a href=\"https://github.com/chibicode/duo\">duo</a> template created by <a href=\"https://github.com/chibicode\">chibicode</a></p>\n\n<p>I’ve forked the repo and made some minor changes.

It’s basically a form of grappling discipline that focuses on ground techniques with the intent of submitting or choking the opponent. The philosophy is to allow a person with smaller stature and physique overcome a larger and stronger foe.</p>\n\n<p>It even coined the nickname <em>the gentle art</em> which perfectly describes how someone can execute a smooth chain of movement in getting an opponent taken down or swept to being submitted by a joint lock, all utilising minimum amount of strength as opposed to knocking the opponent out using a full power punch or kick using striking martial arts.</p>\n\n<p>Its foundation is not heavily based on strength, speed, physical coordination and flexibility, making BJJ somewhat suitable for a person who has never receive any martial art training in life. This doesn’t mean that BJJ requires none of the aforementioned. But it’s true for BJJ that to some extent, the lack of physical attributes can be compensated by techniques.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/H%C3%A9lio_Gracie\">Hélio Gracie</a>, a prominent figure during the early chapters of BJJ, has been repeatedly mentioned in multiple resources as being somewhat smaller in size and having a relatively weak physical condition compared to his peers during his era in the 1930s. Interestingly, the limitation in his physical attributes became the reason of the development of BJJ which emphasised techniques over strength.</p>\n\n<p>So does this mean anybody can do it? This is <a href=\"https://graciebarra.com/\">Gracie Barra</a>’s tagline: <em>Jiu jitsu for everyone</em>. Gracie Barra is one of the biggest, if not the biggest chain of BJJ school in the world, that offers BJJ teaching to everyone from all ages and all walks of life. It does focus more on sport Jiu jitsu, but for those who are not a competitive athlete it still provides the benefit of a good physical exercise and a slight self-defence experience.</p>\n\n<p>Do I agree with the statement?  I say, everyone should give it a try. Even if there’s no intention to compete and the only goal is to get in shape, it’ll do a great job. A regular session would normally be 1 to 1.5 hour long and consists of warm-ups, technique drill and rolling (or sparring) - this varies depending on the school.</p>\n\n<p>Does it really benefit someone who isn’t an aspiring BJJ athlete? Yes.</p>\n\n<p>To give a picture what the exercise is like, a set of warm-ups can be as the following (done continuously without any rest):</p>\n<ul>\n  <li>20 jumping jacks</li>\n  <li>20 squats</li>\n  <li>20 pushups</li>\n  <li>20 arm stretches</li>\n  <li>20 lunges</li>\n  <li>20 pushups</li>\n  <li>20 arm stretches</li>\n  <li>20 sprawls</li>\n  <li>20 pushups</li>\n  <li>20 choke sit-ups</li>\n  <li>20 crunches x2</li>\n  <li>10 chin to chest</li>\n  <li>10 chin to shoulder</li>\n  <li>10 ear to shoulder</li>\n  <li>20 bridges</li>\n  <li>10 bridge to turtle</li>\n  <li>10 shift bases</li>\n  <li>10 leg crosses</li>\n  <li>10 technique stand-ups</li>\n  <li>6 fwd rolls</li>\n  <li>6 back rolls</li>\n  <li>6 shrimping</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>This, added with the technique drill and the rolls should get anyone in shape if done at a regular interval (of course diet plays a huge part as well).</p>\n\n<p>Since most of the schools out there give free first lesson, it’s possible to check out different places before making the decision on picking up BJJ.</p>\n\n<hr />","excerpt":"If you’ve never picked up any martial arts and you decided to try one, then maybe Brazilian jiu jitsu (BJJ) is for you.","languages":null,"categories":["life"],"tags":["misc","pin"]},{"title":"Parsing ICD-10-PCS XML","permalink":"https://ezral.net/Parsing-ICD10PCS-XML.html","link":"https://ezral.net/Parsing-ICD10PCS-XML.html","date":"2020-07-10T00:00:00+00:00","modified":"2020-07-30T09:40:27+00:00","author":{"name":"Ezral","url":"https://ezral.net/","email":"a@ezral.net"},"content":"<h6 id=\"this-post-is-originally-written-on-this-jupyter-notebook-file\">This post is originally written on <a href=\"https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/Ezral/officedoc/blob/master/Parsing%20ICD-10-PCS%20table%20XML.ipynb\">this jupyter notebook file</a></h6>\n\n<h2 id=\"background\">Background</h2>\n\n<p>The goal of this project is to parse ICD-10-PCS XML file into a CSV file that contains 2 columns, the 7 character code and the title (or medical name) with <code class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\">\"@\"</code> separating each level title.

A colleague from work (to whom I’m very grateful!) gave a thorough explanation which provided a great guidance that allowed me to find the right solution. In the process, I learned about XML file structure, strategies that can be used to parse XML and… tqdm package that allows you to see a progress bar for your long iteration.</p>\n\n<p>I didn’t use tqdm progress bar in this notebook because the functions are quite fast to run. I used it running a one hour long for loop function when <a href=\"https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/Ezral/officedoc/blob/master/Wrongly%20parsing%20ICD-10-PCS%20XML.ipynb\">I was trying to brute force all the possible combination</a> out of the unique code characters from the ICD-10-PCS XML file which has 880 tables and returned the output of 368,462 codes! Definitely the wrong way to do it, but ended up learning a lot from that process as well.</p>\n\n<p>Overall, I’m happy with the end result and all the take aways that I got from working this project. On to the next!</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"#background\">Back to top</a></p>\n\n<hr />","excerpt":"This post is originally written on this jupyter notebook file","languages":null,"categories":["data"],"tags":["data","pin"]},{"title":"Spam Filter with Naive Bayes","permalink":"https://ezral.net/Dataquest-guided-project-3.html","link":"https://ezral.net/Dataquest-guided-project-3.html","date":"2020-07-06T00:00:00+00:00","modified":"2020-08-03T01:23:37+00:00","author":{"name":"Ezral","url":"https://ezral.net/","email":"a@ezral.net"},"content":"<h6 id=\"this-is-a-dataquest-guided-project-originally-written-on-this-jupyter-notebook-file\">This is a <a href=\"https://app.dataquest.io/m/433/guided-project%3A-building-a-spam-filter-with-naive-bayes\">Dataquest guided project</a> originally written on <a href=\"https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/Ezral/guided_project/blob/master/Building%20a%20Spam%20Filter%20with%20Naive%20Bayes.ipynb\">this jupyter notebook file</a></h6>\n\n<h2 id=\"background\">Background</h2>\n\n<p>Have you ever felt disturbed by spam messages? I’m sure everybody has. Even those who sent the spam messages have. Fortunately there’s this thing called spam filter that helps us avoid the hassle of repeatedly cleaning our inbox. The goal of this exercise is to create a basic messaging spam filter using Naive Bayes theorem. Isn’t this exciting? It sure is.</p>\n\n<p>We’ll achieve this goal using a dataset put together by Tiago A. Almeida and José María Gómez Hidalgo that has 5,572 SMS messages made available in <a href=\"https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/sms+spam+collection\">UCI Machine Learning Repository</a>.  The messages have been previously classified into spam/ham (not spam) category and can be downloaded from <a href=\"https://dq-content.s3.amazonaws.com/433/SMSSpamCollection\">here</a>. This allows us to “train” the algorithm to classify the messages and later on label whether a certain message is a spam/ham using the following principal:</p>\n\n<p>If the <span class=\"katex\"><span

The setup I’m using in my <code class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\">.zshrc</code> is like this:</p>\n\n<figure class=\"highlight\"><pre><code class=\"language-zsh\" data-lang=\"zsh\"><span class=\"nv\">SPACESHIP_USER_SHOW</span><span class=\"o\">=</span>always\n<span class=\"nv\">SPACESHIP_USER_COLOR</span><span class=\"o\">=</span>green\n<span class=\"nv\">SPACESHIP_USER_SUFFIX</span><span class=\"o\">=</span><span class=\"s1\">' '</span>\n<span class=\"nv\">SPACESHIP_HOST_PREFIX</span><span class=\"o\">=</span><span class=\"s2\">\"@\"</span>\n<span class=\"nv\">SPACESHIP_HOST_SUFFIX</span><span class=\"o\">=</span><span class=\"s2\">\" \"</span></code></pre></figure>\n\n<hr />\n\n<p><strong>3. Installing font</strong></p>\n\n<p>I used <a href=\"https://github.com/tonsky/FiraCode\">FiraCode</a>. Installation instructions can be found in FiraCode <a href=\"https://github.com/tonsky/FiraCode/wiki/Installing\">wiki</a>.\nHomebrew offers a quick way to do it:</p>\n\n<figure class=\"highlight\"><pre><code class=\"language-zsh\" data-lang=\"zsh\"><span class=\"nv\">$ </span>brew tap homebrew/cask-fonts\n<span class=\"nv\">$ </span>brew cask <span class=\"nb\">install </span>font-fira-code</code></pre></figure>\n\n<p>Once installed, select to use the font in your Terminal emulator preference.</p>\n\n<hr />\n\n<p><strong>4. Setting up oh-my-zsh plugins</strong></p>\n\n<p>To install zsh-syntax-highlighting in your <code class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\">~/.zshrcs</code>, first clone the repo:</p>\n\n<figure class=\"highlight\"><pre><code class=\"language-zsh\" data-lang=\"zsh\"><span class=\"nv\">$ </span>git clone https://github.com/zsh-users/zsh-syntax-highlighting.git <span class=\"nv\">$ZSH_CUSTOM</span>/plugins/zsh-syntax-highlighting</code></pre></figure>\n\n<p>Then, enable syntax highlighting in the current interactive shell by adding the line below:</p>\n\n<figure class=\"highlight\"><pre><code class=\"language-zsh\" data-lang=\"zsh\"><span class=\"nv\">$ </span><span class=\"nb\">source</span> /usr/local/share/zsh-syntax-highlighting/zsh-syntax-highlighting.zsh</code></pre></figure>\n\n<p>Note the <code class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\">source</code> command must be <strong>at the end</strong> of <code class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\">~/.zshrc</code>. Next, clone zsh-syntax-suggestion repo as well to install it:</p>\n\n<figure class=\"highlight\"><pre><code class=\"language-zsh\" data-lang=\"zsh\"><span class=\"nv\">$ </span>git clone https://github.com/zsh-users/zsh-autosuggestions.git <span class=\"nv\">$ZSH_CUSTOM</span>/plugins/zsh-autosuggestions</code></pre></figure>\n\n<p>To enable it we need to add the plugin in your <code class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\">.zshrc</code>:</p>\n\n<figure class=\"highlight\"><pre><code class=\"language-zsh\" data-lang=\"zsh\"><span class=\"nv\">plugins</span><span class=\"o\">=(</span>git zsh-autosuggestions<span class=\"o\">)</span></code></pre></figure>\n\n<hr />\n\n<p><strong>5. Organising aliases</strong></p>\n\n<p>If you have your aliases already setup in bash or other shell, you can just copy them directly to your <code class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\">.zshrc</code>, or place them in a file with <code class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\">.zsh</code> extension in the <code class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\">~/.oh-my-zsh/custom/</code> directory. The latter looks more organised in my opinion.</p>\n\n<hr />\n\n<p><strong>6. Add Conda setup</strong></p>\n\n<p>If you’re like me and you’re using Conda for your jupyter notebook, you need to make sure that you put the following script into your <code class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\">.zshrc</code>:</p>\n\n<figure class=\"highlight\"><pre><code class=\"language-zsh\" data-lang=\"zsh\"> <span class=\"o\">&gt;&gt;&gt;</span> conda initialize <span class=\"o\">&gt;&gt;&gt;</span>\n <span class=\"o\">!!</span> Contents within this block are managed by <span class=\"s1\">'conda init'</span> <span class=\"o\">!!</span>\n<span class=\"nv\">__conda_setup</span><span class=\"o\">=</span><span class=\"s2\">\"</span><span class=\"si\">$(</span><span class=\"s1\">'/Users/user/opt/anaconda3/bin/conda'</span> <span class=\"s1\">'shell.zsh'</span> <span class=\"s1\">'hook'</span> 2&gt; /dev/null<span class=\"si\">)</span><span class=\"s2\">\"</span>\n<span class=\"k\">if</span> <span class=\"o\">[</span> <span class=\"nv\">$?</span> <span class=\"nt\">-eq</span> 0 <span class=\"o\">]</span><span class=\"p\">;</span> <span class=\"k\">then\n    </span><span class=\"nb\">eval</span> <span class=\"s2\">\"</span><span class=\"nv\">$__conda_setup</span><span class=\"s2\">\"</span>\n<span class=\"k\">else\n    if</span> <span class=\"o\">[</span> <span class=\"nt\">-f</span> <span class=\"s2\">\"~/opt/anaconda3/etc/profile.d/conda.sh\"</span> <span class=\"o\">]</span><span class=\"p\">;</span> <span class=\"k\">then</span>\n        <span class=\"nb\">.</span> <span class=\"s2\">\"~/opt/anaconda3/etc/profile.d/conda.sh\"</span>\n    <span class=\"k\">else\n        </span><span class=\"nb\">export </span><span class=\"nv\">PATH</span><span class=\"o\">=</span><span class=\"s2\">\"~/opt/anaconda3/bin:</span><span class=\"nv\">$PATH</span><span class=\"s2\">\"</span>\n    <span class=\"k\">fi\nfi\n</span><span class=\"nb\">unset </span>__conda_setup\n <span class=\"o\">&lt;&lt;&lt;</span> conda initialize <span class=\"o\">&lt;&lt;&lt;</span></code></pre></figure>\n\n<p>To activate or deactivate your conda environment use the command <code class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\">conda activate</code> or <code class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\">conda deactivate</code> on your command prompt.</p>\n\n<hr />\n\n<p><strong>7. Colors for terminal</strong></p>\n\n<p>For color, I follow <a href=\"https://github.com/nathanbuchar/atom-one-dark-terminal/blob/master/COLORS\">atom one dark color</a> theme which I applied manually on my terminal preference. Here are the hex colors for both <em>One Dark</em> and <em>One Light</em> theme:</p>\n\n<figure class=\"highlight\"><pre><code class=\"language-txt\" data-lang=\"txt\">One Dark                       One Light\n\nBlack:          1E2127        Black:          000000\nBright Black:   5C6370        Bright Black:   383A42\nRed:            E06C75        Red:            E45649\nBright Red:     E06C75        Bright Red:     E45649\nGreen:          98C379        Green:          50A14F\nBright Green:   98C379        Bright Green:   50A14F\nYellow:         D19A66        Yellow:         986801\nBright Yellow:  D19A66        Bright Yellow:  986801\nBlue:           61AFEF        Blue:           4078F2\nLight Blue:     61AFEF        Light Blue:     4078F2\nMagenta:        C678DD        Magenta:        A626A4\nLight Magenta:  C678DD        Light Magenta:  A626A4\nCyan:           56B6C2        Cyan:           0184BC\nLight Cyan:     56B6C2        Light Cyan:     0184BC\nWhite:          ABB2BF        White:          A0A1A7\nBright White:   FFFFFF        Bright White:   FFFFFF\nText:           ABB2BF        Text:           383A42\nBold Text:      ABB2BF        Bold Text:      A0A1A7\nSelection:      3A3F4B        Selection:      3A3F4B\nCursor:         5C6370        Cursor:         383A42\nBackground:     1E2127        Background:     F9F9F9</code></pre></figure>\n\n<p>The background color I used also follows the One Dark black color which hex is <code class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\">1E2127</code>. You can change it to <code class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\">FEFDF9</code> or <code class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\">FEF4EB</code> if you want a peach colored background.</p>\n\n<hr />\n\n<p>References</p>\n<ul>\n  <li><a href=\"https://github.com/ohmyzsh/ohmyzsh\">Oh-my-zsh</a></li>\n  <li><a href=\"https://denysdovhan.com/spaceship-prompt/\">Spaceship ZSH prompt</a></li>\n  <li><a href=\"https://github.com/zsh-users/zsh-syntax-highlighting\">Zsh-syntax-highlighting</a></li>\n  <li><a href=\"https://github.com/zsh-users/zsh-autosuggestions\">Zsh-syntax-autosuggestion</a></li>\n  <li><a href=\"https://github.com/tonsky/FiraCode\">FiraCode font</a></li>\n  <li><a href=\"https://github.com/nathanbuchar/atom-one-dark-terminal\">Atom one dark for terminal</a></li>\n</ul>\n\n<hr />","excerpt":"MacOSX Catalina 15.5 update changed the Terminal emulator default shell from bash to zsh and I figure it’s the right time to get to know zsh.
