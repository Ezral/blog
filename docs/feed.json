Here’s how I setup my zsh after doing a quick research on the web.</p>\n\n<p><strong>1. Installing oh-my-zsh</strong></p>\n\n<p>I installed <em><a href=\"https://github.com/ohmyzsh/ohmyzsh\">oh-my-zsh</a></em> via curl:</p>\n\n<div class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\"><div class=\"highlight\"><pre class=\"highlight\"><code>sh -c \"$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/robbyrussell/oh-my-zsh/master/tools/install.sh)\"\n</code></pre></div></div>\n\n<p>Oh-my-zsh will write its default <code class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\">.zshrc</code> onto ours and that will makes things easier to customize.</p>\n\n<hr />\n\n<p><strong>2. Setting up oh-y-zsh theme</strong></p>\n\n<p>There are plenty of great looking themes but I like this clean looking <a href=\"https://github.com/denysdovhan/spaceship-prompt\">spaceship</a> theme. Clone the repo to install:</p>\n<div class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\"><div class=\"highlight\"><pre class=\"highlight\"><code>git clone https://github.com/denysdovhan/spaceship-prompt.git \"$ZSH_CUSTOM/themes/spaceship-prompt\"\n</code></pre></div></div>\n\n<p>Then symlink <code class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\">spaceship.zsh-theme</code> to the oh-my-zsh custom themes directory:</p>\n<div class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\"><div class=\"highlight\"><pre class=\"highlight\"><code>ln -s \"$ZSH_CUSTOM/themes/spaceship-prompt/spaceship.zsh-theme\" \"$ZSH_CUSTOM/themes/spaceship.zsh-theme\"\n</code></pre></div></div>\n\n<p>And set <code class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\">ZSH_THEME=\"spaceship\"</code> in your <code class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\">.zshrc</code>. To set up the prompt, you can see the prompt options <a href=\"https://denysdovhan.com/spaceship-prompt/docs/Options.htmlprompt\">here</a>. The setup I’m using in my <code class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\">.zshrc</code> is like this:</p>\n<div class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\"><div class=\"highlight\"><pre class=\"highlight\"><code>SPACESHIP_USER_SHOW=always\nSPACESHIP_USER_COLOR=green\nSPACESHIP_USER_SUFFIX=' '\nSPACESHIP_HOST_PREFIX=\"@\"\nSPACESHIP_HOST_SUFFIX=\" \"\n</code></pre></div></div>\n\n<hr />\n\n<p><strong>3. Installing font</strong></p>\n\n<p>I used <a href=\"https://github.com/tonsky/FiraCode\">FiraCode</a>. Installation instructions can be found in FiraCode <a href=\"https://github.com/tonsky/FiraCode/wiki/Installing\">wiki</a>.\nHomebrew offers a quick way to do it:</p>\n\n<div class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\"><div class=\"highlight\"><pre class=\"highlight\"><code>brew tap homebrew/cask-fonts\nbrew cask install font-fira-code\n</code></pre></div></div>\n\n<p>Once installed, select to use the font in your Terminal emulator preference.</p>\n\n<hr />\n\n<p><strong>4. Setting up oh-my-zsh plugins</strong></p>\n\n<p>To install zsh-syntax-highlighting in your <code class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\">~/.zshrcs</code>, first clone the repo:</p>\n<div class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\"><div class=\"highlight\"><pre class=\"highlight\"><code>git clone https://github.com/zsh-users/zsh-syntax-highlighting.git $ZSH_CUSTOM/plugins/zsh-syntax-highlighting\n</code></pre></div></div>\n\n<p>Then, enable syntax highlighting in the current interactive shell by adding the line below:</p>\n<div class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\"><div class=\"highlight\"><pre class=\"highlight\"><code>source /usr/local/share/zsh-syntax-highlighting/zsh-syntax-highlighting.zsh\n</code></pre></div></div>\n\n<p>Note the <code class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\">source</code> command must be <strong>at the end</strong> of <code class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\">~/.zshrc</code>. Next, clone zsh-syntax-suggestion repo as well to install it:</p>\n<div class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\"><div class=\"highlight\"><pre class=\"highlight\"><code>git clone https://github.com/zsh-users/zsh-autosuggestions.git $ZSH_CUSTOM/plugins/zsh-autosuggestions\n</code></pre></div></div>\n\n<p>To enable it we need to add the plugin in your <code class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\">.zshrc</code>:</p>\n<div class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\"><div class=\"highlight\"><pre class=\"highlight\"><code>plugins=(git zsh-autosuggestions)\n</code></pre></div></div>\n\n<hr />\n\n<p><strong>5. Organising aliases</strong></p>\n\n<p>If you have your aliases already setup in bash or other shell, you can just copy them directly to your <code class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\">.zshrc</code>, or place them in a file with <code class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\">.zsh</code> extension in the <code class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\">~/.oh-my-zsh/custom/</code> directory. The latter looks more organised in my opinion.</p>\n\n<hr />\n\n<p><strong>6. Add Conda setup</strong></p>\n\n<p>If you’re like me and you’re using Conda for your jupyter notebook, you need to make sure that you put the following script into your <code class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\">.zshrc</code>:</p>\n<div class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\"><div class=\"highlight\"><pre class=\"highlight\"><code> &gt;&gt;&gt; conda initialize &gt;&gt;&gt;\n !! Contents within this block are managed by 'conda init' !!\n__conda_setup=\"$('/Users/medicalagent3/opt/anaconda3/bin/conda' 'shell.zsh' 'hook' 2&gt; /dev/null)\"\nif [ $? -eq 0 ]; then\n    eval \"$__conda_setup\"\nelse\n    if [ -f \"~/opt/anaconda3/etc/profile.d/conda.sh\" ]; then\n        . \"~/opt/anaconda3/etc/profile.d/conda.sh\"\n    else\n        export PATH=\"~/opt/anaconda3/bin:$PATH\"\n    fi\nfi\nunset __conda_setup\n &lt;&lt;&lt; conda initialize &lt;&lt;&lt;\n</code></pre></div></div>\n\n<p>To activate or deactivate your conda environment use the command <code class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\">conda activate</code> or <code class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\">conda deactivate</code> on your command prompt.</p>\n\n<hr />\n\n<p><strong>7. Colors for terminal</strong></p>\n\n<p>For color, I follow <a href=\"https://github.com/nathanbuchar/atom-one-dark-terminal/blob/master/COLORS\">atom one dark color</a> theme which I applied manually on my terminal preference. Here are the hex colors for both <em>One Dark</em> and <em>One Light</em> theme:</p>\n\n<div class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\"><div class=\"highlight\"><pre class=\"highlight\"><code>One Dark                       One Light\n\nBlack:          1E2127        Black:          000000\nBright Black:   5C6370        Bright Black:   383A42\nRed:            E06C75        Red:            E45649\nBright Red:     E06C75        Bright Red:     E45649\nGreen:          98C379        Green:          50A14F\nBright Green:   98C379        Bright Green:   50A14F\nYellow:         D19A66        Yellow:         986801\nBright Yellow:  D19A66        Bright Yellow:  986801\nBlue:           61AFEF        Blue:           4078F2\nLight Blue:     61AFEF        Light Blue:     4078F2\nMagenta:        C678DD        Magenta:        A626A4\nLight Magenta:  C678DD        Light Magenta:  A626A4\nCyan:           56B6C2        Cyan:           0184BC\nLight Cyan:     56B6C2        Light Cyan:     0184BC\nWhite:          ABB2BF        White:          A0A1A7\nBright White:   FFFFFF        Bright White:   FFFFFF\nText:           ABB2BF        Text:           383A42\nBold Text:      ABB2BF        Bold Text:      A0A1A7\nSelection:      3A3F4B        Selection:      3A3F4B\nCursor:         5C6370        Cursor:         383A42\nBackground:     1E2127        Background:     F9F9F9\n</code></pre></div></div>\n\n<p>The background color I used also follows the One Dark black color which hex is <code class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\">1E2127</code>. You can change it to <code class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\">FEFDF9</code> or <code class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\">FEF4EB</code> if you want a peach colored background.</p>\n\n<p>References</p>\n<ul>\n  <li><a href=\"https://github.com/ohmyzsh/ohmyzsh\">Oh-my-zsh</a></li>\n  <li><a href=\"https://denysdovhan.com/spaceship-prompt/\">Spaceship ZSH prompt</a></li>\n  <li><a href=\"https://github.com/zsh-users/zsh-syntax-highlighting\">Zsh-syntax-highlighting</a></li>\n  <li><a href=\"https://github.com/zsh-users/zsh-autosuggestions\">Zsh-syntax-autosuggestion</a></li>\n  <li><a href=\"https://github.com/tonsky/FiraCode\">FiraCode font</a></li>\n  <li><a href=\"https://github.com/nathanbuchar/atom-one-dark-terminal\">Atom one dark for terminal</a></li>\n</ul>\n\n<hr />","excerpt":"MacOSX Catalina 15.5 update changed the Terminal emulator default shell from bash to zsh and I figure it’s the right time to get to know zsh.
