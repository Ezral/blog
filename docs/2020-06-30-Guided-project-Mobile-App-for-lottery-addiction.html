<html><head></head><body><p>This is another guided project from <a href="dataquest.io">Dataquest</a> that I recently completed. It’s not really data heave like the usual ones because it’s focusing on probability. I particularly enjoy this one where I learned how to write math formula using TeX. Something different that I tried is using the anchor on the notebook page using the header which turned out to be real simple. For example,</p> <div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>[Click here](#Anchor)
</code></pre></div></div> <p>Will bring you to your <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"># Anchor</code> header. Note that you need to remove the whitespace. If you have space on your anchor, then replace them with <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">"-"</code>.</p> <h2 id="click-here-to-view-the-notebook">Click <a href="https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/Ezral/guided_project/blob/master/Mobile%20App%20for%20Lottery%20Addiction.ipynb">here</a> to view the notebook.</h2></body></html>
