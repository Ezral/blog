    <p>If you’re fortunate enough, you’d have enough fortune to spend to fly¹ you from one location to another for the sake of better medical treatment quality.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>¹All means of air-lifting patient (rotary &amp; fixed wings) that includes commercial seated, commercial stretcher, air ambulance.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Is it popular? Yes, among the wealthy and lucky few. The cost² can easily pays off your car instalments or your kid’s tuition.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>²Air ambulance cost for Jakarta to Singapore sector between the year 2016 – 2017 can vary from $13,000 to $26,000 depending on complexity of medical condition, aircraft type, and origin of aircraft.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Do we need more of these? <strong>Yes</strong> and <strong>no</strong>.</p>

<p><strong>Yes</strong> to bridge medical referral in rural or remote areas with extra-challenging geographical condition. In urban areas, to improve patient’s survival rate by accommodating quicker access to hospital-level intervention for those who need them. I’m talking without data here, but I’m pretty sure that most of the patients massive cardiac tamponade or hematothorax that resulted from chest trauma due to motor vehicle injury would have very little chance of surviving due to this reason.</p>

<p><strong>No</strong> to unnecessary abroad medical referral that costs Indonesia’s economy hundred millions of rupiah. Although many would return feeling satisfied with the outcome of their decision to have medical treatment abroad, not little ended up having the same end result that they would’ve gotten even without the medical evacuation.</p>

<p>A country’s potential financial loss shouldn’t be the main issue here, but it should’ve triggered an action that would address some of the main causes why patients would prefer to spend more just to seek something that they could have back in their home town or country.</p>
