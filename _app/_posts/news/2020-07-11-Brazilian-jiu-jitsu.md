If you've never picked up any martial arts and you decided to try one, then maybe Brazilian jiu jitsu (BJJ) is for you.

In the recent years, BJJ has been getting a lot more attention as mixed martial art is getting more and more popular on the planet.

Being an art that focuses on ground techniques, BJJ doesn't teach any striking techniques. It's basically a form of grappling discipline that focuses on ground techniques with the intent of submitting or choking the opponent. The philosophy is to allow a person with smaller stature and physique overcome a larger and stronger foe.

It even coined the nickname _the gentle art_ which perfectly describes how someone can execute a smooth chain of movement in getting an opponent taken down or swept to being submitted by a joint lock, all utilising minimum amount of strength as opposed to knocking the opponent out using a full power punch or kick using striking martial arts.

Its foundation is not heavily based on strength, speed, physical coordination and flexibility, making BJJ somewhat suitable for a person who has never receive any martial art training in life. This doesn't mean that BJJ requires none of the aforementioned. But it's true for BJJ that to some extent, the lack of physical attributes can be compensated by techniques.

[HÃ©lio Gracie](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/H%C3%A9lio_Gracie), a prominent figure during the early chapters of BJJ, has been repeatedly mentioned in multiple resources as being somewhat smaller in size and having a relatively weak physical condition compared to his peers during his era in the 1930s. Interestingly, the limitation in his physical attributes became the reason of the development of BJJ which emphasised techniques over strength.

So does this mean anybody can do it? This is [Gracie Barra](https://graciebarra.com/)'s tagline: _Jiu jitsu for everyone_. Gracie Barra is one of the biggest, if not the biggest chain of BJJ school in the world, that offers BJJ teaching to everyone from all ages and all walks of life. It does focus more on sport Jiu jitsu, but for those who are not a competitive athlete it still provides the benefit of a good physical exercise and a slight self-defence experience.

Do I agree with the statement?  I say, everyone should give it a try. Even if there's no intention to compete and the only goal is to get in shape, it'll do a great job. A regular session would normally be 1 to 1.5 hour long and consists of warm-ups, technique drill and rolling (or sparring) - this varies depending on the school.

Does it really benefit someone who isn't an aspiring BJJ athlete? Yes.

To give a picture what the exercise is like, a set of warm-ups can be as the following (done continuously without any rest):
- 20 jumping jacks
- 20 squats
- 20 pushups
- 20 arm stretches
- 20 lunges
- 20 pushups
- 20 arm stretches
- 20 sprawls
- 20 pushups
- 20 choke sit-ups
- 20 crunches x2
- 10 chin to chest
- 10 chin to shoulder
- 10 ear to shoulder
- 20 bridges
- 10 bridge to turtle
- 10 shift bases
- 10 leg crosses
- 10 technique stand-ups
- 6 fwd rolls
- 6 back rolls
- 6 shrimping

This, added with the technique drill and the rolls should get anyone in shape if done at a regular interval (of course diet plays a huge part as well).

Since most of the schools out there give free first lesson, it's possible to check out different places before making the decision on picking up BJJ.
