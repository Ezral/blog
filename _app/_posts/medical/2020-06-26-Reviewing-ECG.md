Being able to read ECG was one of my main goals in the late years of medschool. I ended up graduating from not being really comfortable reading them. I'd be able to spot things like myocardial infarction but I wasn't really able to properly read them. There's this one time where a senior doctor would explain the reading of a strip and I was sort of lost. That was the turning point that led me to doing a self study which involved hours of youtube and reading and doing exercises.

I'd strongly recommend the following resources to those wanting to learn to interpret ECGs:
- Watch all ECG  videos in [Touzeau123's youtube channel](https://www.youtube.com/user/Touzeau123/videos),
- Go through [ECG resources in LITFL](https://litfl.com/ecg-library/),
- Finish all 200 ECG problems in [Amal Mattu's book](https://www.amazon.com/ECGs-Emergency-Physician-Amal-Mattu/dp/0727916548).

These will definitely be enough for anyone to master the basics of ECG. If you want to go further however, there's this post written by [Shari Weisenfeld, MD](https://www.roshreview.com/author/sweisenfeld/) that outlines a very detailed [ECG self-study program](https://www.roshreview.com/blog/study-strategies/how-an-internist-learned-to-read-ekgs-better-than-a-cardiologist/) that you can follow to get from scratch to an advanced level.
