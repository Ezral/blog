Being able to read ECG was one of my main goals in the late years of medschool. I ended up graduating from medschool not being really comfortable reading them. I'd be able to spot things like myocardial infarction but I wasn't really able to properly read them. There's this one time where a senior doctor would explain the reading of a strip and I was sort of lost. That was the turning point that led me to doing a self study which involved hours of youtube and reading and doing exercises.

I'd strongly recommend the following resources to those wanting to learn to interpret ECGs. Go through all this: watch all ECG  videos in [Touzeau123's youtube channel](https://www.youtube.com/user/Touzeau123/videos), read [ECG resources in LITFL](https://litfl.com/ecg-library/), and finish all 200 ECG problems in [Amal Mattu's book](https://www.amazon.com/ECGs-Emergency-Physician-Amal-Mattu/dp/0727916548). These will definitely be enough for anyone to master the basics of ECG.
