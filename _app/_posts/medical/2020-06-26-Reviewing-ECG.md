Being able to read ECG was one of my main goals in the late years of medschool. I ended up graduating from medschool not being really comfortable reading them. I'd be able to spot things like myocardial infarction but I wasn't really able to properly read them. There's this one time where a senior doctor would explain the reading of a strip and I was sort of lost. That was the turning point that led me to doing a self study which involved hours of [youtube](https://www.youtube.com/user/Touzeau123/videos) and [reading](https://hwcdn.libsyn.com/p/7/d/0/7d0967dfb2767d3e/ECG_in_Acute_MI_The_-_Unknown.pdf?c_id=8655857&cs_id=8655857&expiration=1593152643&hwt=ca3ce89ec87288cb4fcaa3918827eaf1) and doing [exercises](https://www.amazon.com/ECGs-Emergency-Physician-Amal-Mattu/dp/0727916548). Eventually I was able to read _(though still not great at it)_ properly.

Since I'm not working in a clinical setting at the moment, I'm thinking of reviewing ECGs on a regular basis while documenting them here.
