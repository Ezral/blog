### TL;DR.

This coffee shop is one of best coffee places, if not the best, in Bogor.

### The place

Opened in 2017, Cohere was founded by a group of Indonesian who used to live in Brisbane that share the same passion for coffee.

Before becoming a coffee shop, the building that is now Cohere used to be a big house that has a large garden.
A huge portion of the structure was later converted into a karaoke place and a smaller part of it became this awesome coffee shop.
They also have a big parking space that can fit (maybe around) 25 cars that makes finding a parking spot very easy.

Once you step in, you'll notice two things:

One, huge windows filling the room with natural light throughout the day.

Two, you can see everything starting from the front until all the way to the back. Making you appreciate how spacious it is.

The combination of cement floor, white walls, wooden furnitures, yellow hue light bulbs,
and the touch of greens from the indoor plants do a great job in giving off a warm homey feeling.

The space are divided into 4 separate sections:
- The area over the main entrance that resembles a living room
- The area nearby the coffee bar  
- The more private middle area separated by a sliding glass door that can serve as a co-working/meeting space
- The small outdoor smoking area in the back which is visible from inside through a huge window.

### The Menu

Once you step into the counter area, you'll be able to see the pastries they have on display along with the menu. All food and drinks are halal.

They offer the common espresso based as well as non-coffee drinks which includes selection of healthy smoothies.
My usual, is either a [piccolo latte](https://www.cafeculture.com/industry/general-interest/what-is-a-piccolo-latte), es kopi susu (iced coffee with milk), or a cup of [espresso](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Espresso).
Can't go wrong with espresso.

For their coffee beans, Cohere uses its own house blend which is 100% arabica, as they don't provide anything but specialty coffee.
Their latest addition to the menu, es kopi susu in 1L bottle is now catering for the growing demand of home es kopi susu stock.

For foods, they have a wide selection of appetiser/snack, mains and desserts.
[Cohere's page in zomato](https://www.zomato.com/jakarta/cohere-bogor-timur-bogor) has all the details.
If you ask me, I particularly like the pink carbonara and the brownies with ice cream.

### The service

Cohere opens everyday from 8.00AM - 9.30PM.

The staffs are very friendly and know what they're doing.
The order doesn't take long; it normally takes around 5 - 10 minutes for drinks and 15 - 20 minutes for food.
And if you need to, you can keep the bill open. Which is convenient!

Price wise, it's slightly above your average coffee place in Bogor, but worth every penny. <sub> (in this case, worth every perak)</sub>

For payment they accept: cash, OVO, go-pay and BCA debit card.
They are not able to accept credit card or debit card other than BCA yet (confirmation required).

Another important facts, the toilet is squeaky clean and they offer public wi-fi.

<b style="color:#50A14F">Side-note</b>: If you ever happen to meet Sumi, one of the co-founders, have a chat.
You should go ahead and ask for his food or drink recommendation or maybe just talk about coffee.
Great guy to talk to.

### The crowd

<b style="color:#50A14F">Prior to Covid19</b>: Mostly frequented by the younger spectrum of the population, Cohere is the most crowded during weekends around lunchtime until the afternoon. For anyone who's wondering, it's also family friendly and the smoking/non-smoking area distinction is very clear.

Occasionally the place will be booked for social/work related functions and you might find that there's limited seating, so it might be a good idea to make a reservation beforehand.

<b style="color:#E45649">During Covid19</b>: Following the transition from large-scale social restrictions to the so called new-normal,
Cohere has re-open for dine-in with physical distancing measures. Reservation is recommended during this time.
They will also require you to wash your hand the moment you enter the coffee shop.


### Must visit?

A 100%! I really enjoyed the homey feel that it offers. Even when compared to coffee shops in Jakarta, I'd still say that Cohere would be one of my top choices.

I can't say I've eaten every dish on the menu, but the ones I did try definitely did not disappoint.
As for the coffee, they consistently serve really good quality coffee.

10 out if 10 times, I recommended Cohere to friends or family visiting Bogor whenever they asked for my recommendation.

It's a great spot to add to your destination list when in Bogor. Either to just hang out or to wait the traffic out before driving back to Jakarta.

Give it a shot when you're in Bogor. <sub>(Or if you're living in Bogor but have never been to Cohere before)</sub>
