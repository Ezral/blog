### TL;DR.

This coffee shop is one of best coffee places, if not the best, in Bogor.

### The place

Opened in 2017, Cohere was founded by a group of Indonesian who used to live in Brisbane that share the same passion for coffee.

The structure is formerly a huge old house that has a large garden.
It was later converted into the a karaoke spot that takes most of the space and the rest into this awesome coffee shop.
Because of this, they have a big parking space. I've never any issue in finding parking space as it can fit (maybe around) 25 cars.
So unless both Cohere and the karaoke spot are full, I wouldn't worry about parking.

Once you step in, you can see everything all the way from the front to the back, making you appreciate how spacious it is.

The huge windows provides natural light throughout the day and the combination of white walls, wooden furnitures,
cement floor and a touch of greens from the indoor plants set the right ambience.

The space are divided into 4 separate sections:
- The area over the main entrance that resembles a living room
- The area nearby the coffee bar  
- The more private middle area separated by a sliding glass door that can serve as a co-working/meeting space
- The small outdoor smoking area in the back which is visible from inside through a huge window.

And yes they offer public wi-fi.

### The Menu

Once you step into the counter area, you'll be able to see the pastries they have on display along with the menu. All food and drinks are halal.

They offer the common espresso based as well as non-coffee drinks which includes juice. My usual, is either picollo, es kopi susu (iced coffee with milk), or a cup of espresso.
Can't go wrong with espresso.

For their coffee beans, Cohere uses its own house blend which is 100% arabica, as they don't provide anything but specialty coffee.
And as a newest addition to their menu, they added es kopi susu in 1L bottle to cater for the growing demand of es kopi susu stock at home.

For foods, they have a wide selection of appetiser/snack, mains and desserts.
[Cohere's page in zomato](https://www.zomato.com/jakarta/cohere-bogor-timur-bogor) has all the details.
If you ask me, I particularly like the pink carbonara and the brownies with ice cream.

### The service

Cohere opens everyday from 8.00AM - 9.30PM.

The staffs are very friendly and definitely know what they're doing.
The order doesn't take long; it normally takes around 5 - 10 minutes for drinks and 15 - 20 minutes for food.
And if you need to, you can keep the bill open. Which is convenient!

Price wise, it's slightly above your average coffee place in Bogor, but worth every penny. <sub> (in this case, worth every perak)</sub>

For payment I think they accept the following: cash, OVO, go-pay and BCA debit card.
They are not able to accept credit card or debit card other than BCA yet (confirmation required).

<b style="color:#50A14F">Side-note</b>: If you ever happen to meet one of the co-founders, Sumi, have a chat.
You should definitely ask for his recommendation or maybe just talk about coffee.
Great guy to talk to.

### The crowd

<b style="color:#50A14F">Prior to Covid19</b>: Mostly frequented by the younger spectrum of the population, Cohere is the most crowded during weekends around lunchtime until the afternoon. For anyone who's wondering, it's also family friendly and the smoking/non-smoking area distinction is very clear.

Occasionally the place will be booked for social/work related functions and you might find that there's limited seating, so it might be a good idea to make a reservation beforehand.

<b style="color:#E45649">During Covid19</b>: Following the transition from large-scale social restrictions to the so called new-normal,
Cohere has re-open for dine-in with physical distancing measures. Reservation is recommended during this time.


### Must visit?

Yes! 10 out if 10 times, I recommended Cohere to people visiting Bogor whenever they asked for my recommendation.

It's a great spot to add to your destination list when in Bogor. Either to just hang out or to wait the traffic out before driving back to Jakarta.
Definitely give it a shot when you're in Bogor. <sub>(Or if you're living in Bogor but have never been to Cohere before)</sub>
