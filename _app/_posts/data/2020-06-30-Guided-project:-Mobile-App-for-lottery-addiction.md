This is another guided project from [Dataquest](dataquest.io) that I recently completed.
It's not really data heave like the usual ones because it's focusing on probability.
I particularly enjoy this one where I learned how to write math formula using TeX.
Something different that I tried is using the anchor on the notebook page using the header which turned out to be real simple.
For example,
```
[Click here](#Anchor)
```
Will bring you to your ```# Anchor``` header. Note that you need to remove the whitespace between # and your header. If you have whitespace on your header you need to replace them with ```"-"```. For example ```# Your header``` should be written like this
```
[Click here]#Your-header
```

Click [here](https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/Ezral/guided_project/blob/master/Mobile%20App%20for%20Lottery%20Addiction.ipynb) to view the notebook.
