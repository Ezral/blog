From a colleague's remark regarding data science course, I was somehow encouraged to venture into doing some lessons on [Dataquest](https://dataquest.io). Little did I know that I was going to like it this much.
I figure I'd keep one of the first Dataquest guided projects that I completed in this blog. This one is about [Star Wars movie survey](https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/urls/community.dataquest.io/uploads/short-url/6dRDpeZHZCHxZUwyDrGKo3DMrcv.ipynb).
